## Description

As a user I can delete my account. I am warned of the consequences before committing the action.

When an account is deleted, all personally identifiable information is removed, as well as the ability to log in for that user. All historical data in picks leagues like standings records and picks are retained, but anonymized. Users in leagues with > 1 person and where they are the only commissioner must designate commissioners before deleting the account. Leagues where the user is the only member will be deleted.
